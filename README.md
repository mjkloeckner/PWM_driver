# Pulse-width Modulation Driver

![driver_pwm_wide](https://github.com/mjkloeckner/PWM_driver/assets/64109770/35b2ec00-5e53-4f26-85ab-ca08cb2b6ae3)

This is a simple [Pulse-width
Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) Driver that
can drive LED strips or other DC loads up to at least `18v 3A`. 

## 3D Models

The majority of 3D Models used are from the official KiCAD 3d library. The ones
missing are:

- [16mm Alpha Potentiometer](https://grabcad.com/library/alpha-rv16af-20-1)
- [Screw terminal DG-301 5mm](https://grabcad.com/library/screw-terminal-dg-301-5mm-1)
- TO-220 with trimmed legs: A modification of the default KiCAD TO-220 model
