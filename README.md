This is a simple [Pulse-width
Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation) Driver that
can drive LEDs or other DC loads up to at least `18v 3A`.

## Original Design

The original design is not mine, I found it and made a few tweaks to the values
of the components in order to fit my needs.
